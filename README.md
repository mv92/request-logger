## How to start the listener

I delegated writing of the commit messages to `git commit -m "$(curl -s http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt)"` so please, no judging!

#### This listener requires for the `node`, `pnpm` and `git` commands to work correctly.

#### Main commands

For dev
```shell
pnpm dev
```

For production
```shell
pnpm start
```
